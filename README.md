# 3D_Donut
This repository contains the project 3D Rotating Donut
The work has been inspired by Donut.c and Giovanni Code from youtube

The variables: 
  Radius1 and Radius2 control the radius of the torus and the radius of the circle
  K1 and K2 are used for projection (K1 < K2)

The project uses pygame to achieve this purpose
